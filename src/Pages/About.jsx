I am an emotional, happy-go-lucky girl who loves animals, plants, observing human nature, listening to other’s stories and writing about ideas to make life better in my diary. One day I thought why not share them with others? And that’s how I decided to start this blog.
<br/>
Most of us are so caught up with day-to-day life, busy schedule, workload and home responsibilities that often we don’t realise how easy it can be to deal with issues that bother us. Making life less complicated and more amazing is not a tough task. It’s just
that our minds are occupied with so many things that we overlook simple things, focus on bigger problems, overthink and end up getting overwhelmed.
<br/>
I am here to remind you of such easy breezy tips and tricks!

Perhaps you might be knowing many of them already but while reading the posts here, who knows you will just end up figuring out what you needed to do. Perhaps you just needed someone to show you some ways to simplify life. Perhaps you just needed to talk about it over a cup of tea with a friend.

So, let’s do it often!
